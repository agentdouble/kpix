# kpix

Initial repository setup for the kpix project. The codebase is organized into `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

## Backend
- See `backend/planbackend.md` for the technical plan of the performance management backend (PostgreSQL, APIs, domains).

## Development notes
- Follow the guidelines in `AGENTS.md` for contributions and environment expectations.
- Use `uv` for Python package management for any Python backend code.
- Maintain separate local (vLLM) and API (external provider) modes for LLM usage if/when LLM features are introduced.
