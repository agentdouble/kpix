# kpix

Initial repository setup for the kpix project. The codebase is organized into `backend/` and `frontend/` directories, ready for future implementation.

## Development notes
- Follow the guidelines in `AGENTS.md` for contributions and environment expectations.
- Use `uv` for Python package management if backend tooling is added.
- Maintain separate local (vLLM) and API (external provider) modes for LLM usage when those components are implemented.
